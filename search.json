You can also install R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/) on your machine, but I strongly recommend starting with Rstudio cloud.\nRstudio cloud is free for up to 25 hours/month, you don’t have to maintain it, and it gives gives a standard install (same on all machines, so your intro/ our training may be smoother). You can also do both. If you need help, videos are at :\n\nDownloading R\nDownloading Rstudio\nMaking a Rstudio cloud account\n\nJoin the github classroom we’ll be using for our sessions\n\nhttps://classroom.github.com/a/D7Pmx_95\nWhen you visit the page it will ask you to connect or create a github repository. You can use any name (be anonymous or not) that you want. This is a free process.\n\n\n\n\nOptional (get a head start if you want)\nIt may be easier to open these intructions in a browser so you can follow along there while working in Rstudio!\nAfter you join the github classroom, you’ll make a clone of the repository onto your machine. First, find your copy of the repository. You can follow the github classroom link again, or log into github and then visit https://github.com/settings/repositories. Find the repository called data_science_intro_YOURGITHUBUSERNAME, and click on it. Then follow along below - find instructions for Rstudio cloud or Rstudio desktop depending on your setup.\n\nIf you are using Rstudio cloud…\nVideo at Accepting your first github repository (from github classroom) and cloning to Rstudio cloud\nLog into your Rstudio cloud account. You’ll see something like this:\n\n\n\nRstudio cloud home screen\n\n\nTo copy a repository, select New Project, New Project from Github repo. Next you’ll need to enter the url for your repository. To find this, click on the Code button from the github page for your repository (instructions above!)\n\n\n\nClick on Code to get repository url\n\n\nCopy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the field asking for the URL of your github repository.\nNote you may need to enter your github username and password to create the repository.\nThe next screen will bring you to a “normal” RStudio screen. Continue to the Now we can actually work in R section to get started\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio on your desktop (or via a server…anywhere that\nlooks like an RStudio screen)\nVideo at Accepting your first github repository (from github classroom) and cloning to Rstudio desktop\nTo start working on an assignment, open RStudio.\n\n\n\nSelect File &gt; New Project in Rstudio\n\n\nSelect file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select git. If this isn’t available, you may need to install git (free) on your system. You can download it at https://git-scm.com/download/.\nNext you’ll need to enter the url for your repository. To find this, click on the Code button from the github page for your repository (instructions above!).\n\n\n\nClick on Code to get repository url\n\n\nCopy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio Repository URL space. You can select/edit what you want the repository to be called and where its stored (its just a folder on your computer). For example, I have a Repositories folder in my main hard drive where I save all of these. Then select Create project. Whatever you choose, the project will be saved in new folder in that location using the name you chose. Note you may need to enter your github username and password to create the repository.\nYou also may get an error/warning about personal access token! this happens at different points on different machines (thus why Rstudio cloud is nice). If you see this now, see below for help.\nIf everything work, the next screen will bring you to a “normal” RStudio screen.\nContinue to the Now we can actually work in R section to get started\n\n\nNow we can actually work in R and markdown\nNow you can start working on the files in the repository in Rstudio. To view the files, make sure you are in the right repository. You should see whatever you named the project in the upper right hand corner of Rstudio. If you don’t go to File &gt; Open Project and navigate to where you placed the repository.\nOnce you are in the right project, open the file you want to work on. From inside the project space, go to File, Open File and find it, or look in the Files window to find and open the file.\nFor example, we’ll start our R work with the 1_intro_to_R_and_stats_primer.R file in the Training folder. Open the file, and a window with a lot of text should appear in your Rstudio.\n\n\nEditing, committing, and pushing changes\nTo understand how git works, change line 2 of the 1_intro_to_R_and_stats_primer.R to have your name. Then hit save (disk icon). This saves a copy of the file on your machine. In order for me to see it, we need to push those changes to a github repository.\n\n\nCommitting files to your github repository\nIf you look in the upper right windows, you should see a Git tab. Select it.\n\n\n\nThe git tab allows you to use git commands in Rstudio\n\n\nNotice it has several files. These are the files you have changed or created since you started working. Click the checkbox next to the files, and select Commit. You’ll need to enter a description. Put “My first commit!” and press Commit.\nIf you get a screen that looks like this:\n\n\n\nThis screen means you need to tell your computer who to assign changes to\n\n\nIt just means we need to associate an identity with the commits. To do this, close (x) the git windows. Select the terminal tab:\n\n\n\nThe terminal tab lets you send commands to your computer\n\n\nThen paste this line into the terminal (tab to the right of the console tab), (note you need 2 – should be 2 dashes!)\ngit config –global user.email “you@example.com”\nreplace the email with your email (leave the quotes) and press enter.\nThen paste this line into the terminal,\ngit config –global user.name “Your Name”\nreplace the Your Name with your name (leave the quotes) and press enter.\nNow go back to the git window and try the commit again. It should work. You will only have to do this once (for desktop versions) and only occasionally for cloud-based RStudio instances.\nNow you’ve committed to the file to your local Rstudio instance (on your own machine or server), which is itself a git repository. This is different than a save. A save overwites the current file, while a commit compares changes you have made and tracks them. To see this, you can go the Git tab, select Diff, and then History on the pop-you. From there, you can select the commit, select any file you committed, and actually see the changes. This allows you to go back to (or just see) earlier versions easily, which is often helpful in programming.\n\n\nPushing to github\nNow you need to push these changes to the cloud so I can see them (or, in the future, so you could share with collaborators or save a copy for yourself). From the Git tab, select Push. As of Fall 2021, Github no longer accepts usernames and passwords for authentication. However, Rstudio may ask you for these depending on what version you are using. Don’t be surprised if you enter your password correctly but your attempt to create a repository (or push commits to it) still fails because you need to setup or reset a token.\n\n\n\nIf you see this, it means you need to setup or reauthorize a github token\n\n\nIf you see this message now, go to the Github 2-factor authentication (required as of Fall 2021) section!). If not, you can continue, but note you’ll have to do it later (when you push changes).\n\n\nGithub 2-factor authentication (required as of Fall 2021)\nGithub requires you to use a token to verify you have permission to make changes to repositoties that you store there. To create a token, can use the code below. If this file is open in R, you can select the green triangle button (play icon) to run the current chunk. Otherwise you can copy and paste it into R. Note you may also need to install the usethis library first.\n\nlibrary(usethis)\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThis will launch a browser pointed to github. You may need to log in. Then it will have you name a PAT (personal access token). You can, for example, name it Rstudio. Then scroll to the bottom, and select Generate Token. Save the token somewhere (you’ll never see it again once you close the window). Then run the next code chunk. Select 3, then paste in the token you just generated. Again, you may need to install the gitcreds package.\n\nlibrary(gitcreds)\ngitcreds_set()\n\nThis process is letting your computer and github communicate and should only need to be done once for a desktop. For rstudio.cloud, you will need to regularly reenter the token, but you don’t have to recreate it. So save you PAT somewhere just in case. If/when you lose it, however, you can simply make a new one and reconnect the repositories.\nOnce you enter your git credentials, try to push your changes again. It should work this time. A window should appear. When it’s done (white text shows) go to your github repository (on the web). Open the folder for this assignment and click on the .md file. It should preview, and you should see the updated file with your name! Congratulations!\nAs you work, use commits to save snapshots of your work in a version control manner, and pushes to share them. If you get stuck, you can also push your file up so I can see it and help you fix it (much better than “My code isn’t working). Then you can actually see”how” I fixed it. The code will also be useful for assessments.\n\n\n\nExtra resources\n\nEasy (but no longer updated) intro to R\n\nYaRrr!
